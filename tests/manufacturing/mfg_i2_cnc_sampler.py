# The same part for a CNC cutter of 6 mm (inside corners of radius 3, gaps of 6, nothing out of reach from above).
#
# HOW TO READ THIS FILE: everything that is tested is written in it, from the top.
#   the part         built below from boxes, cylinders and spheres, by hand: nothing about it is computed
#   the constraint   the rules the part has to keep -- the only conditions the tool is given (no loads, no supports of a structure, no material)
#   the tool         manufacturing_optimization (and the check, manufacturing_analysis): its work is done by python/fieldes/stdlib/manufacturing*.py, which you can open:
#                      - the rules of the CNC preset (corners, gaps, undercuts, walls)
#                    nothing in this file tells the tool the answer
#   answers by hand  numbers typed in below, with the sum they come from.  Nothing computes them; the checks compare what the tool made with them
#   the checks       helpers in mfgkit.py / mfgtest.py: a tape measure through the result's field, material counted on points, the independent check of the result (no mesh is exported)
# Output pane: one PASS or FAIL line per check.  Viewport: the result (grey as it was, red material added, blue material cut) beside the part as it was.
# LOOK AT THE PICTURE: the numbers are an aid, what you see is the proof.  Turn it, zoom in (View > Top / Front / Right: the keys 7 / 1 / 3).
